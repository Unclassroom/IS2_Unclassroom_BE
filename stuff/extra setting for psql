https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-postgresql-with-your-ruby-on-rails-application-on-ubuntu-14-04

alter the user admin so it can create databases:
ALTER USER admin CREATEDB;
    
make the /etc/postgresql/9.6/main/pg_hba.conf file look like(only linux:ubuntu) :


# Database administrative login by Unix domain socket
local   all             postgres                                md5

# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD

# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local   all             all                                     md5
# IPv4 local connections:
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            md5
# IPv6 local connections:
host    all             all             ::1/128                 md5
# Allow replication connections from localhost, by a user with the
# replication privilege.
local   replication     postgres                                peer
host    replication     postgres        127.0.0.1/32            md5
host    replication     postgres        ::1/128                 md5
